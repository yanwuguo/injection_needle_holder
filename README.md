## 3D printed injection needle holder
### *Important: this design is for the needle with 1mm outer diameter*
The needle made with needle puller has very fragile tip. It is important to keep the prepared needles safe. 
The needle holder can be printed with 3D printer and hold up to 19 needles.
Print the needle holder (STL file) and glue it in 15cm petri dish instead of using clay.
